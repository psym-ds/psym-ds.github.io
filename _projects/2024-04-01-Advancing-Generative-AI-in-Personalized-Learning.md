Objective:
1. Resource Compilation: Gather high-quality open educational resources, including course materials, articles, and other learning tools.
2. Content Creation and Interaction:
- Develop tailored prompts for guiding the AI model to generate targeted outputs based on learning objectives, topics, and difficulty levels. Specifically, we will create prompts that generate learning plans, lecture notes, explanations, or examples related to a particular topic.
- Establish web and API methods for users to engage with the AI using prompts.
3. Personalized Assessment and Feedback:
- Design prompts for the generative AI model to provide personalized assessments and feedback.
- Evaluate learner responses and offer improvement suggestions.
